GeneratePress is device friendly (mobile and tablet), uses 100% valid HTML, is fully schema microdata integrated, is translated into over 20 languages by our amazing community and is cross browser compatible (IE9+).

Some of our features include 9 widget areas, 5 navigation positions, 5 sidebar layouts, dropdown menus (click or hover) and a back to top button.
