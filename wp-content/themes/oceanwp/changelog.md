### *2016.12.20* - 1.1.0
Warning: The name of the theme changed to OceanWP because Ocean was already taken, WordPress will see the OceanWP theme as a new theme, so, you need to do a fews steps, look at this video:
https://youtu.be/s5TUYhUMc-8

1. In your WordPress dashboard, go to Theme Panel > Import/Export, and click on the export button, this will generate a json file.
2. Install and activate the Widget Importer & Exporter plugin and go to Tools > Widget Import/Export to export your widgets.
3. Download the new version of the theme on oceanwp.org.
4. Return to your WordPress dashboard and upload the new version.
5. If not already done, update WordPress, then, update all extensions.
6. Go to Theme Panel > Import/Export and import the json file of the step 1.
7. Go to Appearance > Widgets and delete all your widgets to prevent conflicts (optional).
8. Go to Tools > Widget Import/Export and import the .wie file exported to the step 2.
9. Check that everything is ok on your site, if so, go back to Appearance > Themes and delete the old Ocean theme.
10. if you use a child theme, replace "wp_get_theme( 'Ocean' )" by "wp_get_theme( 'OceanWP' )".

Do not worry, all your changes made to the theme will not be affected because I've not modified any filters, action or theme_mods.
I'm really sorry for that, there will never be any changes of this kind again, I want the theme to be available in the WordPress directory, and the name Ocean was already taken in the waiting list, so I had to modify it to OceanWP.

Do not hesitate to contact me via facebook or trough the support page if you have misunderstood or you are having an issue.
