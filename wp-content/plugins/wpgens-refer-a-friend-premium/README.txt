Referral System for WooCommerce. Each customer has referral link that rewards them with a coupon after someone makes a purchase through their link

== Description ==

### WordPress Refer A Friend Plugin ###

This plugin will enable you to create a simple but powerful referral system on your website. Instead of giving money to your referrals, you are rewarding them with coupons that they can use to get discounts when buying on your website, or even free products, depending on a coupon settings.

The plugin will create a unique URL for each of your WooCommerce members, link that is visible on their account page. In premium version you can show it with shortcode as well. Members can use this referral link to invite people to your site, and every time someone comes to your site through their link and makes a purchase, you will reward them with a coupon.

= Coupons Are Connected With WooCoupons. This Allows You To: =

* set the value of each coupon;
* define the type of the coupon;
* define the minimum order;
* determine whether the coupon is product specific or not; (PREMIUM only)
* set a coupon expiry date (PREMIUM only)

After order is marked as complete, coupon is sent to a person who referred you a customers. Every time referral receives a coupon, it will be shown on his account page and only he can use it.

As with our other plugins, refer a friend is coded with best practice, it is super light and will not slow down your site.

== Installation ==
