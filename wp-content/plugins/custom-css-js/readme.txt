== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Requirements =

**Browser requirements**
* Firefox - version 4 and up
* Chrome - any version
* Safari - version 5.2 and up
* Internet Explorer - version 8 and up
* Opera - version 9 and up

= What if I want to add multiple external CSS codes? =
If you write multiple codes of the same type (for example: two external CSS codes), then all of them will be printed one after another

= Will this plugin affect the loading time? =
When you click the `Save` button the codes will be cached in files, so there are no tedious database queries.

= Does the plugin modify the code I write in the editor? =
No, the code is printed exactly as in the editor. It is not modified/checked/validated in any way. You take the full responsability for what is written in there.

= My code doesn't show on the website =
Try one of the following:
1. If you are using any caching plugin (like "W3 Total Cache" or "WP Fastest Cache"), then don't forget to delete the cache before seing the code printed on the website.
2. Make sure the code is in **Published** state (not **Draft** or **in Trash**).
3. Check if the `wp-content/uploads/custom-css-js` folder exists and is writable

= Does it work with a Multisite Network? =
Yes.

= What if I change the theme? =
The CSS and JS are independent of the theme and they will persist through a theme change. This is particularly useful if you apply CSS and JS for modifying a plugin's output. 

= Can I use a CSS preprocesor like LESS or Sass? =
For the moment only plain CSS is supported, but you can check out the [Pro version](https://www.silkypress.com/simple-custom-css-js-pro/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_campaign=ccj_free&utm_medium=banner) in case you need a CSS preprocessor.

= Can I upload images for use with my CSS? =
Yes. You can upload an image to your Media Library, then refer to it by its direct URL from within the CSS stylesheet. For example:
`div#content {
    background-image: url('http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/image.jpg');
}`

= Can I use CSS rules like @import and @font-face? =
Yes.

= Who can publish/edit/delete Custom Codes? =
By default only the Administrator will be able to publish/edit/delete Custom Codes. Check out [this article](https://www.silkypress.com/simple_custom_css_js/user-capabilities-simple-custom-css-js-plugin/) for more details on roles and user capabilities customizations.

= Compatibility with qTranslate X plugin =
* If the [qTranslate X](https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate-x/) plugin is adding some `[:]` or `[:en]` characters to your code, then you need to remove the `custom-css-js` post type from the qTranslate settings. Check out [this screenshot](https://www.silkypress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ccj_qtranslate_compatibility.png) on how to do that.
