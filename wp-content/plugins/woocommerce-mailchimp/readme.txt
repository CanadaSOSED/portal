== Description ==

WooCommerce MailChimp provides simple and flexible MailChimp integration for WooCommerce.

Automatically subscribe customers to a designated MailChimp list and, optionally, MailChimp interest groups upon order creation or order completion. This can be done quietly or based on the user's consent with several opt-in settings that support international opt-in laws.

**WooCommerce Event Selection**

- Subscribe customers to MailChimp after order creation
- Subscribe customers to MailChimp after order processing
- Subscribe customers to MailChimp after order completion

**Works with MailChimp Interest Groups**

- Set one or more interest groups to add users to based on the selected MailChimp list.

**Opt-In Settings**

- MailChimp double opt-in support (control whether a double opt-in email is sent to the customer)
- Optionally, display an opt-in checkbox on the checkout page (this is required in some countries)
- Control the label displayed next to the opt-in checkbox
- Control whether or not the opt-in checkbox is checked or unchecked by default
- Control the placement of the opt-in checkbox on the checkout page

= Translation Support =

Would you like to help translate the plugin into more languages? Join our Translations Community at https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/woocommerce-mailchimp.

WooCommerce MailChimp translation is managed through WordPress language packs here: https://translate.wordpress.org. This allows WooCommerce MailChimp to be translated into other languages. The preferred tool for translating plugins is called [GlotPress](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/). You can [read about how GlotPress works in the WordPress Translator's Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/).

Thanks in advance for your help on any translation efforts!

We also support bundled translations via:

- Included woocommerce-mailchimp.pot file
- WPML support via wpml-config.xml

**Included Translations:**

- English (US) (default)
- French.

**Custom Translations**

If you don't want to use WordPress language packs or bundled translations, you can use your own custom translations.

- Place custom translations in `/wp-content/languages/woocommerce-mailchimp/woocommerce-mailchimp_{lang}_{country}.mo`. This ensures they won't get overwritten by plugin updates.

**Translation Loading**

If no custom translations are present, languages will be loaded in the following order:

- From WordPress language packs in: `/wp-content/languages/plugins/woocommerce-mailchimp/woocommerce-mailchimp_{lang}_{country}.mo`
- From the plugin bundled in: `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-mailchimp/languages/woocommerce-mailchimp_{lang}_{country}.mo`

= Multisite =

- All features should work for each blog in multisite installations.

= Requirements =

WooCommerce MailChimp requires PHP 5.4+ (PHP 7.0+ recommended). You'll also need to be running WordPress 3.5.1+ and have WooCommerce 2.2+.

**WARNING:** This release contains breaking changes to the plugin's action hooks and filters. If you have custom code that hooks into the plugins action hooks and filters, please review the breaking changes below to know how to update your code appropriately.

**Breaking Changes**

- Action filter `ss_wc_mailchimp_subscribe_merge_vars` is now `ss_wc_mailchimp_subscribe_merge_tags`
    - The filter no longer contains the `GROUPINGS` sub-key for [MailChimp Groups](http://kb.mailchimp.com/groups) due to a change with the MailChimp API v3.0.
    - The filter now only contains the [MailChimp Merge Tags](http://kb.mailchimp.com/merge-tags).
- [MailChimp Groups](http://kb.mailchimp.com/groups) now have their own action filter `ss_wc_mailchimp_subscribe_interest_groups`

    - The key `listid` has been changed to `list_id` in the `$subscribe_options` parameter

    - The `update_existing`, `replace_interests` and `send_welcome` keys have been removed from the `$subscribe_options` parameter since they are no longer supported by the API.
    - The plugin now always updates existing subscribers if they exist.
    - The plugin now always appends interest groups and does not affect existing groups on subscribers.
    - The send welcome email can be configured on the target list and is not required to be sent through the API.
    - A new key `merge_tags` has been added and includes the `$merge_tags` array to be sent to the MailChimp API
