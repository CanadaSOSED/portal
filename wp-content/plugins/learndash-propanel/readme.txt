== FAQ ==

= Do I need to update? =

It is always recommended to update. However given the nature of WordPress and the option to have many other plugins installed, custom code, etc. it is possible that a conflict would arise. This is why we always recommend testing the update on a development environment first. 

= Why am I getting an error notice when trying to update? =

If you are getting an error while trying to update your version of LearnDash LMS, verify that your license is still valid. 

Both your license key and email address should be entered via LEARNDASH LMS > SETTINGS > PROPANEL LICENSE.

If you see an invalid license message, you can find your correct information via our [Support Site](https://support.learndash.com/articles/my-downloads/).

If your license has expired, you can purchase a new one [here](https://www.learndash.com/pricing-and-purchase/). ProPanel is part of both the Plus and Pro package.
