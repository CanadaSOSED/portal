I'm sorry, but it's impossible. You should add this attribute to Products>Attributes at first and use "Filter by Product Taxonomies".

The theme or another plugin outputs some lines. Usually, there are extra empty lines at the end of functions.php(in active theme).

You  should open tab "CSV" and setup ISO-8859-1 as codepage.

Yes, you can email a request to aprokaev@gmail.com. We intensively develop this plugin.
