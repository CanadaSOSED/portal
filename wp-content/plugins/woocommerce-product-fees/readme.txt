WooCommerce Product Fees allows you to add additional fees at checkout based on products that are in the cart.

== Description ==

A WooCommerce plugin that adds a product settings tab for creating additional fees that show up at checkout if that product is in the cart.

In the WooCommerce products edit screen, there will be a new product data tab called 'Product Fees' where you can:

* Give the fee a custom name that is displayed to the customer at checkout describing the fee.
* Enter the cost of the fee as either a flat rate number or as a percentage.
* Choose whether or not the fee should be multiplied based on the quantity of the product in the cart.

There will also be similar fields within each variation tab on the product. If the variation does not have a fee, it will fallback and look to use the product fee if one exists.

For the plugin settings, you can go **WooCommerce > Settings > Products > Product Fees**. Here you will find two settings:

* Fee Tax Class - Assign a tax class to be applied to fees, or leave it so fees are not taxed.
* Fee Name Conflicts - Choose whether fees with the same name should be combined or not.

= Features =

I have kept this plugin simple on purpose. It is very lightweight and should not conflict with any other plugins or themes. Here are the features included in the plugin:

* Percentage based fees that go off of the product's price.
* Variation specific fees.
* A quantity multiplier that can be toggled on/off per product and per variation.
* Option to combine fees with the same name.
* Ability to assign a tax class to be used on fees.
* Coupon setting that will remove fees when added.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.0 or greater
* WooCommerce 2.2 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce Product Fees, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click Add New.

In the search field type “WooCommerce Product Fees” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading this plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
